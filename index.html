        <p> Hello! My name is Dallin Patterson and I am from Mesa, Arizona. Currently I live in the Oklahoma City metro area. 
          I enjoy spending time with my family, learning new things, playing sports, 
          being outdoors when it's cool out, and seeing different areas of the world. I am in the California Air National Guard while my civilian job is for a military contractor.
          I do the same thing for both entities. My Guard job allows me opportunities to see my country and serve locally, while my civilian job takes me around the world to serve military members
          and other nationalities. I love being able to find fellow members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in all parts of the world.
        </p>

        <h3>Arizona, USA
        </h3>
        <img src="images/usa-arizona-flags-abstract-david-g-paul.webp" alt="U.S. and AZ flags" width="200">
        <p>Arizona, the sunniest state in the U.S., has something for everyone thanks to the early Natives and settlers who braved the heat to make it a habitable place.
          The best thing about AZ is the ability to do outdoor recreational activities nearly every day of the year. If the valley gets too hot to be outside, one can simply drive a maximum of 30 minutes
          to the nearest mountain range or reservoir to cool off. Aside from outdoor activities, visitors will find an abundance of authentic Native American and Hispanic culture.
